    <h1> The Orca </h1>
    <h3> are you sure you know... </h3>

    <p>Orcas are really well known, but are you completley sure that you know them well?
      The first thing I must say is that they are smart, they have different types of hunting methods for al their different types of prey.
      Seals are most well known, but do you know how they get it of the iceberg. Then sea lions, how do they get them of the beach. 
      Well here I am going to tell you how, these brainy folk do their hunting, and other types of tests we have done on them.
      They live basically everywhere, you might see them in any sea and you might even see them flopping about on the beach, but why? </p>
    <img class = "center" src = "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.8vH9KePVK3YDNsuWC5lQVwHaE7%26pid%3DApi&f=1" / >

    <p>So first of all, seals and narwhals. If you know this, well done, otherwise: Orcas hunt in packs, this means that they will share the food, and help each other.
      To get seals of icebergs, they charge to the iceburg creating a small wave behind them and just before they reach the iceberg they duck down.
      This creates a big wave that knocks the seal(s) of the iceberg and that is lunch.</p>

    <p>When you thought sharks were apex predators. Tut tut tut. Anyway, orcas hunt sharks, 1 shark vs 1 orca, orca wins.
      Orcas don't eat the whole shark, but firstly they must have an A in biology. They know which part is the healthies and the tastiest.
      Here is the method: using their wide tail, they fling the shark up into the air to the surface on some watery vortex.
      Next, with more biology knowlege, and they flip the shark over putting the shark in something scientist call 'tonic imoblity'
      which basically stops the shark from moving. Now paralyzed, it's a nice and tasty meal. Next Penguins: </p>

    <p>If you thought orcas eat things either smaller or about the same size as whales, you are wrong.
      These guys eat whales, the hunt can go on for ours, but in my opinion its worth it. 
      As whales are mammals they breathe through the whole at the top, orcas: They block the top whole stopping the whale from breathing,
      then the ram into it's fins and after a few hours it drowns, not being able to hold it's breath and escape from orcas chasing it. Sad but true.</p>

    <p>Fish, everyone and thing eats fish. So do orcas, but instead of charging they have their own way: 
      They surround the fish making them go in circles, then using its tail it slams the fish stunning the fish, giving it time to eat.
      Then after a while they leave the school and get on with other stuff. Easy.</p>

    <p>And last but not least sea lions and elephant seals. Remeber at the start when I said  'you might even see them flopping about on the beach.'
      This is why. Sea lions and elephant seals. They can't make a massive wave because they can't burrow into the beach.
      They can't do any fancy biological attacks because they are on the beach, waiting will take to long and stunning won't work. So there is only one way.
      They beach themselves, grab the snack on the beachfront and scoot. That's it.
      They are the only animals that actually beach themselves to get food and then unbeach.</p>

    <p>Now, I think that I did miss out a few facts about them. Firstly, they aren't sharks, whales or fish. They are dolphins.
      Secondly, they have been found learning the dolphin whistles and the 'language' when an ocra befriended a dolphin.
      As you all should know, they can echolocate. These guys can't smell, obviously. They can live as long as we can and you can find them everywhere.
      They can recognise themselves in a mirror.</p>
