    <h1> Animals and facts you probably never heard of !!!</h1>
    <h3> Starting with... Aye-ayes: </h3>
    
    <p> First thing you should know about aye-ayes is that they are primates, so they are related to us, humans. 
      But being primates, they are very special as they have many things that we and other primates don't. 
      So for example this is the only primate to have 6 fingers which, in the place it lives (Madagascar) and to what it eats, is useful.
      It needs this to hang on to branches and it has a famous middle finger, if you've heard of this animal.
      The middle finger the aye-ayes have is, for the people of Madagascar, is a fatal message.</p>

    <p> Now after a bit of an introduction lets have a look at what they can do and what we can't. 
      At  first glance you look at them and think that satin is coming to get you, well thats what the natives of Madagascar think. 
      They kill them. That's why there are so few of them left in the wild. 
      But if you decide to have a look at them, or maybe find out about them, they are a lot more than what you think.  
      These guys are the only nocturnal primates in the world, which might mean nothing, but this means that they need special ways to hunt. 
      Now, one of the things you can find out from sight is that they, have 6 fingers. 
      This definitely helps them hunt as they spend all their lives in the trees.
      The sixth finger is probably their to help hold onto branches.
      But to what the aye-aye eats, it'll need something else to help find insect larvae. Echolocation. 
      So just  letting you know that they are the ONLY primates that can echo-locate. But they use it not the way bats do. 
      They use it by tapping their third finger on some wood and then just listens, and if it hears the noise of the tapping rebounding,
      then it will dig a hole in the tree and attempt to find the larvae if there is any.  </p>

    <p> Although, they don't really only eat larvae. They do eat some sensible stuff, for example, honey, fruit, nectar and seeds. 
      But I also hate to say fungi. So to collect some food they do come to the ground. As well as to drink water. 
      And they do it differently. Using their middle finger, they, 8 times a second, move their finger up and down from the water to their mouth. 
      And to me, that's fast. Some other weird facts is that their teeth grow permanently, like rats, so if you see them eating wood, 
      their just shortening their teeth. That is why a long time ago they were classified as rodents.</p>
